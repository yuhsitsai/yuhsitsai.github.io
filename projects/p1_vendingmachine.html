                <p class="text">
                    For our final project in EDES 301, our team of three decided to build a simple 
                    vending machine. As our summer course was part of the ISEED study abroad program, 
                    we had limited access to materials for this project. However, I am pretty pround of
                    how it turned out. 
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    In the project, I was responsible for the electronics and code, connecting a keypad, 
                    a lcd screen, and the coin detecting mechanism (a photoresistor and a LED) through 
                    an Arduino Mega to the three motors that released the items.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    The largest challenge in the project, a least for me, was by far is the wiring. 
                    The amount of electrical components we had ended up requiring a huge amount of 
                    wires, and with only jumper wires and the need to fit everything into a small 
                    box, it took some delicate rewiring to finally fit everything in.
