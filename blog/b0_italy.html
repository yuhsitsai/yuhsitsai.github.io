                    We spent the first three weeks in Bologna. I arrived over a weekend yet slept most 
                    of it away, so my first real day exploring Bologna was on Monday. I walked downtown 
                    along Via dell'Indipendenza and saw the iconic two towers, sadly now enclosed by 
                    construction.

                <p class="text">
                    That Thursday, I decided to go further and walk to San Luca, a sanctuary located on top 
                    of a hill at the end of the world's longest portico (666 arches!). Though it was definitely
                    a tiring walk, the view was totally worth it.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    On Friday, our class visited the Ducati museum and factory on the city's outskirts. 
                    Seeing the production lines of these luxury motorbikes was really cool.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    On Saturday, I hopped on the regional train and headed to Ravenna, a small city 
                    about an hour away, the former capital of the Western Roman Empire (!). I took 
                    a walking tour to see the ~1500 year-old mosaics, which I would highly recommend. 
                    While there, I also visited the grave of the famous poet Dante.

                    For Sunday, I went even further, catching a bus in the morning to go to Milan. 
                    I visited the famous Duomo, the pinacoteca di Brera, Castle Sforzesco, drank 
                    an extremely overpriced cola in Navigli, and had overall a great time. 
                    The Duomo, with all its details, was extremely impressive up close.
                </p>

                    The second week was a bit busier since EDES 301 is coming to an end and we spent
                    our time working on our final project 
                    (<a href="../projects/p1_vendingmachine.html">which you can read about here</a>). 
                    However, I still managed to fit in some 
                    sightseeing. On Tuesday, our class headed to Florence. We visited two museums, 
                    Museo Galileo which displayed cool old scientific equipment, and Museo Leonardo 
                    Da Vinci. After that, a few of us decided to walk up a hill to 
                    Piazzale Michelangelo, where we got a good view of the city, 
                    unfortunately somewhat ruined by the pouring rain.

                    On Friday our class headed to the Museo del Patrimonio Industrale, which showcases 
                    the rich industrial history of Bologna. I thought it was a fun visit especially 
                    since some of the machines can still be started and were very cool to see in action,
                     and I ended up learning a lot about Bologna's history in general.
                </p>

                    On Sunday I decided to visit Verona, a city to the north of Bologna. 
                    The city is famous for being where Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet is set, 
                    so of course I visited Juliet's house with the balcony and famous statue. 
                    For lunch I had a classic local dish - Risotto all'Amarone. Though it looks vaguely 
                    questionable at first sight, it was really delicious, if a bit too salty.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    After lunch, I walked up a hill (It's kinda becoming a theme…) to Castel San Pietro, 
                    where I saw beautiful views of the whole city. Nearing the end of my visit, I took a  
                    walk around Arena di Verona, the city's Roman amphitheater. Imagine my horror when I realized 
                    the bus that was going to take me back to the train station was canceled. I ran for twenty minutes 
                    straight, made it in time, only to find out my train was delayed by 15 minutes…
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    The next Tuesday, some classmates and I took 6 hours of trains in total to see the famous leaning 
                    tower of Pisa. We climbed the tower and you can really feel the tilt in the tower as you're doing so. 
                    We also visited the attached cathedral and museum, then ate at this great pasta place that lets you 
                    customize your own pasta.
                </p>

                    As our days in Bologna were numbered at this point, I decided to spend my Wednesday afternoon 
                    further exploring the city. After lunch, my first stop was a gelateria, Delizie Bolognesi. 
                    Their Nettuno flavor (a blend of sea salt, vanilla, and lemon zest, with added pistachio crunch) 
                    was my favorite in Italy. I then visited the Civic Archaeology Museum and the Archiginnasio Palace. 
                    The museum has a really large collection of ancient Roman and Egyptian artifacts. The palace's 
                    main feature is the anatomical theater, which is the room where dissection lectures were held.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    I also visited some beautiful churches, namely the Basilica of San Domenico and the seven churches of 
                    Santo Stefano. I finished up my walk at the Osteria dell'Orsa, where I had the Bolognese classic 
                    tagliatelle al ragu.
                </p>

                    Over the weekend, some classmates and I decided to visit Naples and Pompeii. After arriving in Naples 
                    on Saturday, we visited the duomo and the underground tunnels. There was a part in the tunnels where 
                    we had to squeeze through a really tight passage, so that was fun. After that we went up a hill to 
                    castel sant'Elmo, where we saw some beautiful views of the city.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    On Sunday, we visited Pompeii and Mount Vesuvius. At Pompeii, we saw a lot of old Roman ruins and even 
                    went into some of them. We then took a bus halfway up the mountain and hiked to the top to see the crater.
                    While the crater was cool (you can see a little bit of steam coming out), the unobstructed view of the 
                    entire area was even better.
                </p>

                    The last week, we headed to Turin, another city in north Italy. There, we visited the space company 
                    Thales Alenia, which was really cool. I also tried bicerin - a local specialty drink that includes 
                    chocolate, espresso, and cream - which was extremely delicious.
